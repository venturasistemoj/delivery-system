# Pure Java Data Structures

## Overview
This demo project highlights the use of Java data structures. The code models a fictitious non-productive delivery system solely for the purpose of exemplifying the use of the List, Set and Queue interfaces, as well as their various implementations.

## Getting Started
As the project's main objective is to show the use of Java data structures, the system interface operates on the command line; which can be started in the Main class.

## Documentation
The system's documentation and business rules are commented in the code.

## Testing
The project includes unit tests with JUnit and Mockito at the [tests](src/test/java/tests) package.
